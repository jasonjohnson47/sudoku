This is a work in progress. It started as a learning experience and challenge to try to write JavaScript to solve Sudoku puzzles. I'm hoping to build it out to a fully functional game that let's you play Sudoku and can be used to help solve puzzles. All the functions to solve the puzzle were written from scratch. As a Sudoku novice I referenced solving techniques online and approached writing the functions to solve cells as a human would solve them using those techniques. Initially I was creating it with vanilla JavaScript. This project is built using React.
